\begin_layout Abstract
Recently, high demand and limited scalability have increased the average
 transaction times and fees in popular cryptocurrencies, yielding an unsatisfact
ory experience.
 Here we introduce Maxima a cryptocurrency with a sharded block-chain, one
 where the network is divided into partitions called shard which maintain
 their own blocks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In Maxima, validator committees are sampled for each shard.

\series bold
 
\series default
Validators vote on the availability of blocks to the network, and are shuffled
 off shards very quickly.
 Once a committee has determined if a block is accessible to nodes on a
 shard, nodes on that shard execute the transactions and verify the blocks
 validity- producing a succint fraud proof if the block is invalid.
 Cross shard transactions are managed using tools from distributed systems,
 like locks and yanks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Maxima is a globally distributed computer that is secure under an honest
 majority assumption, and puts in place mechanisms to prevent adaptive adversari
es from corrupting the network.
 With 20 shards, Maxima is projected to process over 20,000 transactions
 per second.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation and Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Bitcoin, blocks are added to the block-chain approximately every 10 minutes,
 at a relatively fixed pace that results in a TPS of 5-7.
 Simple solutions to expanding the capacity of the block-chain have found
 natural limits to their efficacy: enlarging blocks runs up against user
 bandwidth limits; hastening the rate at which blocks are mined increases
 orphaning.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more promising solution to the problem of scaling is to run separate chains
 that process transactions within partitions of the network, called shards.
 The key challenges are: (1) how to manage the communication between the
 different shards, a problem which is closely related to ensuring the atomicity
 of transactions in a distributed system and (2) how to run these many separate
 block-chains in a way that does not compromise on security, since each
 shard-chain will only have a fraction of the mining/validation power of
 the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we propose mechanisms to ensure the atomicity of transactions
 and to ensure that the security of separate chains is not compromised.
 We adopt an honest majority assumption for the network, assuming fewer
 than a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 of 0.25 nodes are Byzantine.
 Note 
\begin_inset Formula $f=0.25$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary constant bounded below 1/3 to ensure good constants.
 We also put in place safe-guards against adaptive adversaries who may bribe
 network participants.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this in mind, our protocol can be described below.
 Validator committees are sampled for each shard.
 Sampling validators randomly means that with a sufficient number (400)
 we can ensure an honest majority of 2/3 of per shard almost surely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Validators then vote on the availability of blocks to the network, and are
 shuffled off shards very quickly.
 This fast shuffling is to ensure that an adaptive adversary does not have
 the time to find and corrupt the validators of each shard.
 Because of this fast shuffling, the work that a validator can perform must
 be very minimal.
 Validators check that the data corresponding to the Merkle root of a block
 is accessible to a shard, so that the members of a shard can execute those
 transactions.
 If there is a dispute about transaction execution, validators also resolve
 disputes by considering succinct proofs of invalid execution.
 Cross shard transactions are managed using tools from distributed systems,
 like yanks, to ensure that transactions can be executed atomically.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Inspiration and Original Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to thank: Ethereum and Dfinity for the idea of separating
 state execution from data availability checking; Ethereum for the idea
 of using Erasure Coding to prove availability; Zilliqa and Dfinity for
 the idea of forming committees using random sampling to vote on blocks.
 Our original contributions are: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Formalising a concrete mechanism for multi-dimensional self-authenticating
 erasure codes, without checking more than O(1) Merkle roots.
 Previous solutions have relied on further data availability proofs or an
 increased burden on verifiers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We are the first to apply erasure codes to prove that a program's intermediate
 state execution has been committed to the network, which enables the generation
 of succinct fraud proofs that execution is incorrect.
 Previous solutions to off-loading state execution, like Trubit, relied
 on rounds of interactivity to generate proofs of incorrectness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We also developed variants of a cross shard locking system which were eventually
 adapted by Ethereum to a cross-shard yanking system, which we have also
 adopted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Protocol Structure 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The construction of our protocol depends on the following, relatively independen
t components, which can be subdivided into three themes: voting schemes;
 data creation and concurrency controls.

Consensus Schemes

\begin_layout Section
Voting Schemes - Forkful vs Fork-free
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of block-chain protocols: those that
 admit forks and those that don't.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the chief benefit of forking consensus protocols like Bitcoin, is
 that they allow the network to recover from majority attacks.
 Even if a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dishonest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 majority creates an invalid chain, so long as the network recovers its
 honest majority, the invalid chain may be overtaken by a valid one.
 we may summarise this by saying: In Bitcoin, votes are continuously validate
 prior blocks and so no block is truly finalised.
 It may at any point be reverted.
 Conversely, in fork-free protocols, such as PBFT, once a vote validating
 a block occurs it is final.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, in the context of a sharded block-chain forking consensus protocols
 need a great deal of extra apparatus due to inter-shard dependencies.
 If a fork on the block-chain occurs on shard A, and shard B has blocks
 that depend on the state in shard A, then a reversion of blocks on shard
 A will need to effect a reversions of blocks on shard B.
 Tracking all the state dependencies and ensuring that reversions do not
 revert too much of the global state is still an unsolved problem in the
 block-chain space.
 This problem is compounded by the fragmentation of state that comes with
 sharding.
 If state is distributed across many shards, then a large proportion of
 transactions on the block-chain reference state between shards, meaning
 a large number of dependencies, and reversions on one shard causing reversions
 on many others .
 Bearing these thoughts in mind, a sharded block-chain must either: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Track inter-shard dependencies created by transactions, and determine an
 efficient way of reverting those changes, thereby maintaining the resilience
 of the block-chain to majority attacks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Adopt a consensus protocol that admits no forks at the application layer,
 thereby losing the flexibility of a block-chain to withstand short-lived
 50% attacks on the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Maxima, we adopt the second approach but with the following fail-safe:
 In the event of a large-scale attack, whether clients would chose the dishonest
 chain or chose to revert those changes would be determined largely by social
 consensus: a proof that an attack had been performed by a dishonest majority
 with encouragement from the Maxima organisation about which block to revert
 to.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having made the case for forking chains, it should be noted that in the
 entire history of Bitcoin only once was a block-chain reverted by more
 than its finalisation threshold of 6 blocks.
 This incident occurred due to a mining consortium not checking block validity
 when mining.
 However, a social layer of consensus has been used at least twice to change
 the protocol.
 This means that using social consensus to resolve short-term attacks does
 not come with much overhead, if historical precedent is to be assumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More concretely, our voting scheme: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Having said that, Maxima's approach would be to prevent any form of attack,
 and to provide stronger safety guarantees than Bitcoin- for instance by
 adopting proof of stake which reduces miner centralisation
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are significant economies of scale that come with proof of work mining:
 a huge amount of R&D funding is put into developing custom hardware for
 mining; low cost energy in certain parts of the world make mining pools
 far more attractive in parts of China than elsewhere.
 Such economies of scale are not present in proof of stake systems, which
 reduces miner centralisation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, a number of popular block-chain protocols are also fork-free
 and so far fault tolerant, they include: NEO, Zilliqa,EOS.
 We aim for our system to be as resilient as these, but with much greater
 scalability due to sharding.
 In the long term, we will also explore methods for forkful sharding that
 resolves the problem of tracking inter-shard dependencies and reverting
 on block-chain forks, although that is not the present plan.

\begin_layout Section
Achieving Fork-Free Consensus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fork-free protocols typically use BFT style algorithms.
 These are systems where a vote for a block consists of a prepare followed
 by a commit.
 They have been modified in recent times to create significant improvements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The PBFT modification - have a leader who aggregates votes to improve efficiency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Subsample from the entire population so many validators are voting but not
 all (in Zilliqa, they use X).
 If say 400 participants are voting and we assume that f<25% are byzantine.
 We can show that the probability more than 2/3 of those voting are also
 byzantine is less than the number of atoms in the universe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Ensure the right kind of marginal incentive structures exist.
 One can dot his by using a system similar to Caspar slashing conditions.
 Not only does this act as a deterrent, but will also be a key sign of bribary
 that could lead up to a social consensus step.
 
\end_layout

Key to security is fast shuffling.

 They can't maintain state on each shard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Blocks are created within each shard, and the merkle root is signed on and
 shared with other shards.
 The question we now have is this? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) How can we ensure that all of the data contained within a shard is available
 to all members of the shard?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) Given that data isavailable, this means anyone can report flaws.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question is how can we prove that a block is available? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could require a majority of half the sampled validators perform availability
 checks and then sign off on the availability of a root.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Question is how can we feed in the right marginal incentives? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Have rewards for attesting yes, but with penalties if they don't have proof
 they checked for data availability.
 This means nodes are incentivised to say yes if they do have the data,
 but won't declare yes if they don't and know others won't check them.
 small reward for saying no.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
randomly check availables for a reveal, with sufficinelty high penalty that
 makes lying unprofitable.
 Also allow challenges for those who know ing wrong.
 For those who don't require a random reveal with sufficiently high penalties.
 => say that a person has 10 blocks to do so before being slashed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
unavailable|available are losing their rewards 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If they are aware many other people do not have access to the data, they
 may vote yes anyway.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
However, we don't want validators to have to actualy execute the state.
 This would take too long.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
How can we resolve this issue? Ethereum uses Truebit, which takes the form
 of an interactive verification game.
 The main issue with truebit is that it requires multiple rounds of verification
 and thus can result in low latency in cases where there is a dispute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The approach that we take is to erasure encode the trace of the execution.
 We use a 3d erasure encoding to ensure that the fraud proofs are of a size
 cube-root(n).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Again using sampling techniques, we can assign validators to each transaction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Stateless clients 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Self-Authenticating Erasure Codes 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We want validators to be able to guarantee that honest nodes can access
 data on the network, or stated more succinctly that 
\series bold
data is available
\series default
.
 A simple way for validators to check that data is available is to download
 a whole block.
 So, in the current scheme we would sample a set of validators - say 400,
 which is enough to guarantee an honest majority of participants.
 Then all of these shards would attempt to download the data from the network,
 and finaly take a vote between themselves on whether the data is available.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, to increase efficiency, we would like to use a scheme where each
 validator need not download the entire block.
 If blocks were really large, say GB sized, which would be ideal for scalability
, it may be impractical to have validators enter a shard and download multiple
 blocks to verify availability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can avoid this, if we take a sampling approach.
 However, validators will not sample directly from the block itself, but
 instead will sample from an erasure code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do we want validators to check that data is available for a block? If
 the data for a block is available to the network, this means that honest
 executors on a shard can check to see if there are any faults with it and
 produce succint fraud proofs, O(1) sized proofs that a block contains invalid
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What this ultimately means is that executors on a shord can check to see
 if 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We don't actually want the validators to perform the executions themselves
 because doing so would take too long for large blocks of for transactions
 that take a long tiem to execute.

Enforcing Authentication 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an element in 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 does not satisfy it's authentication constraint, i.e 
\begin_inset Formula $e[(f_{ij},i,j),y_{ij}]\neq y$
\end_inset

 and element is available then this can be proved in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\sqrt{m})$
\end_inset

 .
 Say that an element in the second square does not satisfy its constraint,
 this can be proven from 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{(m)}$
\end_inset

 elements in the corresponding column.

\begin_layout Subsection
Proof of Uniqueness

If it is possible to construct more than one element in the

 index of any of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

, then an O(1) proof is given by presenting something like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $(d_{00},0,0),x_{00}$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $(d_{00}^{'},0,0),x_{00}^{'}$

\begin_inset Formula $d_{00}\neq d_{00}^{'}$

Proof of Liveness 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given points 8.1, we can prove liveness.
 Suppose all available elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $D,F,G$
\end_inset

 satisfy the authentication constraints and are unique (if they are not
 succinct fraud proofs may be given, then: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the data for a row 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{i*}$
\end_inset

 is unavailable then:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
#available elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i*}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $<\sqrt{m}$
\end_inset

 or equivalently:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
#unavailable elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{i*}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $>(k-1)\sqrt{m}$
\end_inset

 .
 This implies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
#unavailable elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $>(k-1)^{2}m$
\end_inset

 or equivalently:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
#available elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

\begin_inset Formula $<k^{2}m-(k-1)^{2}m=(2k-1)m$

Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years.
 Your PDF file must only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts.
 Here are a few instructions to achieve this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You should directly generate PDF files using 
\family typewriter
pdflatex

You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.
 In Acrobat Reader, select the menu Files
\begin_inset Formula $>$

Fonts and select Show All Fonts.
 You can also use the program 
\family typewriter
pdffonts
\family default
 which comes with 
\family typewriter
xpdf
\family default
 and is available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.
